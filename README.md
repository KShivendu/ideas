## Ideas

These are some of my project ideas:

- [x] Monitoring personal health metrics and time spent on screen. [Done](https://www.kshivendu.dev/blog/quantified-self)
- [ ] Scrape all data from Bangalore rental platforms (NoBroker, Housing, MyGate) so it's easier to search/filter through them and track changes over time. [In Progress](https://github.com/KShivendu/blr-housing)
